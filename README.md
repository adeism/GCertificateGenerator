2. **Google Slides Template:** Create a Google Slides presentation as your certificate template.  Use placeholders like `{{Full Name}}`, `{{Email}}`, `{{Date}}` enclosed in double curly braces.
3. **Google Apps Script:** Open Script editor (Tools > Script editor) in your Google Sheet.
4. **Google Drive Folder:** Create a folder in Google Drive to store generated certificates.
5. **Configuration:**  At the top of the script, update the following constants:
    * `FOLDER_ID`:  The ID of your Google Drive folder.
    * `TEMPLATE_ID`: The ID of your Google Slides template.
    * `EMAIL_SUBJECT`:  The subject of the email.
    * `EMAIL_BODY`: The body of the email (use placeholders like `{{Full Name}}`).


## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Copy the provided Google Apps Script code into the Script editor.
2. Configure the constants at the top of the script with your specific IDs and email details.
3. **Install Triggers:** In the Apps Script editor (Edit > Current project's triggers), add a new trigger:
    * `Function`: `onFormSubmit`
    * `Event source`: `From spreadsheet`
    * `Event type`: `On form submit`

## Usage üöÄ

1. Enter data into your Google Sheet, including "Full Name" and "Email" for each recipient.
2. Submitting the form (or directly editing the sheet) triggers the script.
3. The script generates a certificate, converts it to a PDF, saves it to your Google Drive folder, and emails it.
4. The sheet's "Status" column updates to "Processed" or "Failed", and a link to the PDF is added.
5. Logs are recorded in the "Log" and "Error Log" sheets.

| --------- | --------------------- |
| John Doe  | john.doe@example.com   |
| Jane Doe  | jane.doe@example.com   |


## Troubleshooting ‚ö†Ô∏è

* **Permissions:** Ensure the script has necessary permissions (Drive, Gmail, Slides).
* **Error Log:** Check the "Error Log" sheet for details on any errors.
* **Placeholders:** Verify placeholders in your Slides template match your sheet's column headers.
* **Configuration:** Double-check `FOLDER_ID`, `TEMPLATE_ID`, email subject, and body.
